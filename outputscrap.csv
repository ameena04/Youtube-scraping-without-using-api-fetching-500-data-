Its about Mathematical Optimization.', b'Python and R are among the easiest languages', b'I think the largest difference between the two programs is that MSBA was created for a marketplace needs in which there were a plethora of data scientists who had programming and quantitative experience; however, they had no general business domain knowledge and that MSBA combines both general business and programming in efforts to have people who can communicate with managers.  Data Science is technical and the best data scientists have now been in the profession for a decade and are comfortable with machine learning, regressional modeling, and variable modeling.  In terms of career: demands for data scientists are highly needed, and their salaries may be higher than MSBA, but their salaries may become stagnant and there is a possibility that their skills will be replaced through AI and machine learning, but MSBA can move a little bit more throughout the industry.  Either way, do what you will enjoy the most and can see yourself doing regardless of salary difference.  If you are very technical and want to work in a back room on a computer all day maybe data science is for you, but if you need face to face interaction and project-based initiatives maybe MSBA is better suited for you.', b'Overall, it is a great video that helps some undergraduates like me who is looking for MS degree in these area.

Then you can even have reports on the flow through pages mixed with events, analyse drop offs at pages and/or events, basically doing all that Mixpanel allows to do. The only thing is - as was referred to by @zinc1oxide, GA data has to be fully anonymous. But even that you can circumvent and set it up with a UserID anonymised and bang! It maps to your internal info of a user. After saying that, the only difference I see between GA and Mixpanel is the interface differences and the ways you accomplish stuff. Also the events in GA are limited to 500bytes of info in text fields (category, action, label) meaning you cannot send any payload length you want.', b'Great video!

Also while pursuing this career I think that choosing your favourite sport would be a good idea. So as I mentioned without having any prior experience in the skillsets, how can I prepare a roadmap for becoming a cricket performance analyst? Will mathletics broaden the generalised view over sports analytics and help in relating to cricket as well to start of as a fresher? I'd really appreciate your feedback on my questions Sir."", b'In really interested in sports analytics or data science as a field. I am only in high school, so what majors would be good to pursue this kind of job? Would you suggest something like statistics or computer science?', b""Hi Ken, thank you very much for this video! Very informative! I've been exploring data science for a few years now, and I believe I have all the skills necessary (R, Python, SQL, PowerBI, statistics,...). I would love to get into the sports analytics field professionally, but I haven't found the right channels to do that yet. I'm also in the Chicago area, so I was wondering if you have any specific tips to network with people in the sports analytics field? In your experience, what are some of the interesting organizations in the IL area and how would you recommend approaching hiring decision makers?""]",795,5

I have a 7 year old Mite that is having a great time playing 3/4 ice hockey.', b'I\'d also like to see a comparison between ADM practices VS scrimmage/game practices. The stats for ""touches"", passes, shooting might be close but most of those drills don\'t teach ""hockey sense"" and measure the ""FUN"" that kids have. Drill drills drills isn\'t the most fun thing for kids. Ask any kid what their favorite time of practice was and its almost always scrimmages (or the shootouts drill). Know when to pass is as important as how to pass. Directional/coached scrimmages is totally underrated. ', b'how come there were not any analytics on the half ice being shown in the video? I am wondering what the difference between cross ice and half ice is', b'Thank you USA Hockey! While I would like to hear more details behind the components of their video, I am glad to see it! (I plan to follow up with them to learn more...) This follows on the heels of their video last year showing a large pond cleared with huge nets to demonstrate to adults just how large a regulation rink nets look to a kid!', b'Very true. I believe it also forces a coach to roll all the lines due to the uptempo of smaller surface ice(if there smart) therefore allowing more kids to develop. No one can say with absolute certainty who the next best player will be... if you think about it (not including up front cost for boards & staff to install)smaller ice also allows for maximum use of ice time for that age group - aka more kids on the ice at once should lower costs per team(four teams on the ice versus only two)... it also allows for other age groups to get their ice times at better slots...there is way to much upside to the concept.  Btw Canada has been on the idea for some time... anything that helps the sport should be shared', b'\xf0\x9f\xa4\x97\xf0\x9f\x91\x8d', b'Did you ever think about the goalies', b""This is a small sample. Small half ice hockey is great for kids learning how to play. However, not the best for every kid. \n\n   I have two kids playing hockey. One was in 8U and the other in 10U. The one that was in 8U wasn't performing to his potential and skill and was otherwise bored watching his teammates be puck hogs on a small congested surface. When his brothers 10U team was short players I had him dress and play up. There was some concern based on his performance in 8U, but I knew he could skate. He was one of the fastest/best skaters on the ice, wound up playing a few more games and ending up 3rd on the team in scoring in a 3rd of the games played."", b'Having taught hockey school for the last decade I\'ve become a big fan of small surface games for kids.  \n\nThe defensive skills, pivots and backwards skating of the D-men at the early ages are far too easily overwhelmed by a good skater or larger/heavier kid carrying the puck up what is a HUGE surface when occupied by 10 60 lb kids.  Throw in parents saying ""Don\'t pass it to your (less skilled) line mates... it\'s a waste of the puck... it\'s like passing it to the other team"", and you\'ve got a recipe for a break-away relay.  (the kid of the Dad who actually instructed his kid this within ear shot of my kid got 34 goals and 3 assists the following summer in his 4 on 4 league - by minor midget, the boy was a layman single A player - far too predictable to get the job done after the D-men had learned to skate well) ', b'My kids had passed the mite level when this was coming out. Being an official I was interested to see how this would play out. One of the things discussed was that soccer for younger players play on a smaller field. After looking at it, it did and does make sense. The only problem is that mite games was a good place for young officials to get their starts, now if they need a ref, it is only one. I have also heard that in some places in house squirts are playing cross ice or half ice.', b'Great ad.  Hope some minds get changed', b""Statistics is a game itself... Vegetables have 100x the fiber of steak... These stats show only things that got higher in cross-ice. Measure how many times a player gets up to full speed in cross-ice vs. full-ice for example - that's a hockey skill you need to develop also. Like it's best to mix vegetables and meat - maybe it's best to mix different size ice surfaces during a season..."", b'My son has been playing cross-ice for 3 years, and will be ""graduating"" to full ice next year. He KNOWS that playing on full ice is different, and is totally stoked to be able to learn and use the blue line and icing. The ADM approach has really improved his skills, and he absolutely loves the practices, but he lives for the games. We have the best coaches at the RMU Island Sports Center, and that right there is what has kept him interested and learning for his entire time there. When he is ready for a traveling team or a school program, I\'m pretty sure that he will have all the skills and development needed to be a great teammate and player. Thanks, coaches!', b'Ahh a friend made some GREAT points...\n\nIf Cross-Ice is so great then why did they feel the need to grab some good players from teams that play their league games as full-ice within AAU and only do their practices within USAH.', b'In finland you play on half of the arena until youre like 9?', b""Problem with cross ice is that it doesn't teach the rules of the game like offside, icing, and penalties!"", b'A U8 team made up of kids who grew up from day one in ADM just finished playing a full ice tournament in Detroit at the AA2 level and went 6-0 giving up less than 40 shots over six games. Even the ref noticed the difference in passing and TEAM play, he commented ADM 6- AAU 0 ..... and that team was from Virginia, as in below the Mason Dixon line.', b'X ICE HOCKEY is a highly effective training method for developing of superior skills and hockey sense in players at all age levels, not just for players at 8U level.', b'concept good, but at younger age. watching these novice aged kids, they must have recruited the best 20-30 kids to play to boost the stats?. like to see stats on a rural Canadian rink with 30-40 kids of different abilities.']",LIKE,DISLIKE

Yet their methods of telling it to the audience were clearly way out of context. Mathematics should not be mystical, such that it becomes ungraspable; it should be explained and appreciated for its rigor and intuitive creativity combined. Thank you for this content, I appreciate it because it is detailed, but not overly rigorous for the sake of rigor alone, so that it becomes inspirational. That is what education in science and math should be: inspiring others to want to learn, rather than shoving the information in their skulls. Education in science and mathematics is something this country lacks in, and content creators like you can help change that.', b'Me knowing Calculus: \n\n\n3Blue1Brown:  ""If you know calculus, you know we can take the derivative at any of these [complex] inputs""', b'All I understood was why who ever solves this gets a million dollars', b'How did you learn to make your graphics?

His point of view and presentation is flawless and up to the point. 3Blue1Brown nails the gap between rigor and inspiration. His work is monumental to say the least. Math is not about bursts of sudden creativity. Math is about rigor, details, hard work and deductive reasoning. If we want to see math in full detail we simply read books for it however we must communicate that rigor and that clean way of thinking. People need to get rid of the notion that mathematics is hard and impossible to grasp. A well written book and full derivation of the theorems gives the right idea of what mathematics is about.
